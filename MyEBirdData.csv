Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Target birds were RNGR, SUSC, HADU, LIGU, PAJA, POJA.    Unforgettable day on my Big Year. Strong N/NE winds prompted me to decide on lakewatching the night before and take the day off from work. Erick texted me saying he'll be headed to promontary point to watch with Jacob, so I went there at first light. Nearly 0 movement on the lake (the entire day!), Jacob, Peter and Cameron leaving, and Erick asked about 566, so we headed there after a few hours. Erick left after few hours, Andy Sigler stumbled upon us and joined me for most of the 566 watch. Around 1pm, him and I paused our conversation and remarked at the dark seabird blasting south, and the rest was history. 10 birds from tying the Cook record."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

At first I thought it was a pigeon, but the rapid wingbeats and slightly different body shape pointed me towards peregrine. I followed it with my eyes until it landed 60% up on the northeast corner of the building on the intersection where the pin is. I ran to grab binoculars and a few colleagues to show them the bird. The bird perched for a few minutes before diving straight down onto the western sidewalk on Michigan ave below it, flushing a few pigeons. I could not see what was happening based on the angle, and strangely pedestrians didn't seem to flinch in that vicinity. I wonder if it dove but then rerouted mid-air, out of sight from me due to the awkward angle that didn't allow me to cleanly look down Michigan avenue head-on."

In the past month, I’ve only detected this bird here one other time.","Monthly birdwalk led by Wendy Paulson. Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Large brownish shorebird with long and slightly upturned bicolored bill. Brown underneath wing ruling out Hudwit. I've documented over 10 shorebird sp. here this Fall and this bird was unmistakeable with my 2-3 second flyby view. Flew from north to south of the pond, following the west side and could not be relocated. Either it left completely or relocated to an area I couldn't see it. More likely the former but based on the way I flushed it, my gut says the latter. It flew low and slow when flushed. I've been trying for a MAGO all year during their peak months and I believed July was going to be my make it or break it. I spent countless hours at montrose beach waiting for one to touch and go. Now I've started checking deadstick for RNPH, WESA, BBSA, BNST, anything else I need for my big year as I gave up on MAGO. No photo and I *might* have merlin audio because it called once and I had it recording and it's saved, listening back I didnt hear anything but will comb through to add more documentation when I have time one of these evenings. I don't bring my camera in because the mud splashes upwards and the first time I came here it splashed into the lens, I have a long lens that hangs pretty low to the ground when slung. After flushing it I immediately ran to the car and grabbed my camera and risked it, trying to refind it for a photo to no avail. Good luck chasers!

When comparing our 3 jaeger species, PAJA is considered the most common and easily viewable from land with the right winds and luck. Bird picked up in Cook County waters without a shadow of a doubt, proceeded into Indiana waters after zipping N to S.    Juvenile bird. Medium sized gull-like seabird with striking, continuous splotch of a white flash on underwings, cinnamon brown body, blaze nape, acrobatic and falcon-like flight style not buoyant or tern-like, not half dark bill but rather 1/3 dark lead me to cross out Long-tailed Jaeger and decide between Parasitic and Pomarine. Compared to POJA, this bird has a relatively smaller, narrower head. Overall less bulky and deep chested than a POJA, this bird has a more uniform pattern and even weight distribution giving it a sleeker look. Per photos and during direct observation, bill seemed thinner than expected on a POJA. In terms of colors, note the bird's blaze of a blonde nape/collar which is big for separating from POJA, on top of it's chocolatey brown and yes, cinnamon-brown plumage captured well with my photos. The tail helps seal the deal here: more pointed central tail feathers shown in photos compared to what POJA's consistently show in their bluntly squared off tail tip. Photos of my bird banking up also show the upper tail quite well for the more PAJA-like covert barring! A lack of a double white flash is not diagnostic for ruling out POJA but notable as well. Reiterating the most critical points which lead me to calling the bird are the nape, body plumage, build, tail (!!!), upper tail coverts in photo of it banking, bill, head size. I was initially caught off guard by the bird's flight style and extensive white flash, but recollecting the sighting, referencing photos and fellow birders (thanks to many folks including Woody, Amar, Simon, Owen, Matthew, Lucas, Mike to name a few), I have confident justification for PAJA and calling it!    How I got the bird: noting the strong N/NE winds, I posted up at the bend of park no.566 with snacks and a dream. It was an incredibly slow day with only pintails moving every half hour, but my birding buddy Andy S emphasized that jaegers and gulls are on different schedules than ducks. With the winds blasting in our faces, waves crashing on the park's rocks leading to water droplets spraying us every few minutes, we handled the monotony by chatting and brief scans of the lake. At approx. 1:28pm, we spotted a dark gull-like seabird blasting North to South at around 10 o'clock directionally from the bend, around 200 yards away, maneuvering over the intense waves. As Andy remarked ""Huh, that's interesting"" I stumbled out of my chair, grabbing my camera, racing to the edge of the rocks and screamed ""JAEGER, THAT'S A JAEGER!!!"" Quickly firing off photos and struggling to get focus and balance, the bird had mostly passed us headed South East. Right off the bat, we didn't notice the white flash but instead the thinness of the wings, dark body, slender build, speedy flight, and striking collar of the bird. An incredible encounter for my 283rd Big Year bird. Unforgettable self-find, mythical seabird rarity, only so many state records and apparently a site record if accepted. Photos added with enhanced exposure to assist with details and will submit extensive documentation of RAW and edited files to IORC when I have more time.","20mph N/NE winds with notably strong E component right in our faces, 70 degrees, waves splattering on the 566 rocks and wetting lakewatchers every 15 minutes.

I decided to camp out at the pier starting at 11am in the hopes that with the winds from the SW and hot day incentivizing people to crowd the surrounding beaches, the gull would seek the protected beach as safe refuge again. This species doesn't sit for long periods of time in cook county per records and I missed one this year already. After 5+ hours of sitting in the sun on the pier, flies biting my ankles, and a horrible sunburn, the bird appeared as I was packing up to leave.

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions.

Small, more compact and dark birds with striking dark upper and underparts to their wings, black on face contrasting with white when seen in good light, broader wings giving a shorter wing appearance, ""bouyant"" but my word I'd like to use here would be ""undulating"" flight patterns while flying down towards the water's surface to presumably forage whilst migrating with speed and intention. Spotted at the 566 lakewatch location safely in cook county waters and viewed for a few minutes as they flew past the imaginary lake border into Indiana. distant but discernable birds seen with favorable lighting, sun slowly setting to the west. Winds strong from N and slightly from East and several rare lake birds spotted in NW Indiana led Tarik to move to this lakewatch spot in the afternoon hoping to nab a SAGU, LIGU, or jaeger that ventured from IN waters. Several BLTE's confirmed in NW Indiana today, part of a larger migration day for them with both time of year and several hundred miles of stretching wind setup. As Phil spotted and called out the birds uniqueness, Tarik had spotted them within the same few seconds, a neat moment. Not bats, as I'd seen hundreds on several days this Fall, and not chimney swifts which have made my heart skip a beat more than once in the past few weeks. Both viewers are experienced with CATE and smaller sterna diving to forage and watched distant RGBUs dive and swoop along the lake, which were unlike our birds."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Flyover headed Southeast, more E than S. Spotted at 11:51am, arrived behind a flock of 45 SACR high in the sky, circled in the sky twice, stopped pursuing, and soared to the SE. 2nd GOEA along the Des Plaines River this Fall, with a 3rd bird spotted by Mike McBrien west of Lincoln Park (North pond presumed).      Presumed juvenile bird based on plumage characteristics. Enormous, dark brown raptor with smaller head and head projection than BAEA, namesake golden nape, white at tail base, white at base of inner primaries and bleeding into base of secondaries. Did not fly with noticeable dihedral as noted in flight descriptions for the species. (Perhaps too slight for me to notice in the moment).     Noting the NNW winds, low 30 temps, and Dan Hayes' comments about significant SACR movement over the Des Plaines River, I decided to head to western Cook for a lottery chance at GOEA. I first posted up at the Oakton College parking lot, but after the first SACR flock appeared to the west of the river, I googled the closest, expansive green space to the west (All Saints Cemetery), and staked out in its eastern portion. Sunroof and windows down, I heard the first flock of SACRs and exited the car checking for WHCR, GOEA, etc. Immediately noticed the flock flying SW with a large, dark raptor high and in pursuit. A RSHA glided passed the raptor, perhaps what saved the SACR flock from further worry by drawing brief attention from the unidentified bird. With the cloudy sky, the only plumage characteristics I initially noted on the bird was its overall dark coloration. After snapping my first photo and checking it in the viewfinder, I saw a hint of white in the remiges, raised my exposure compensation, and snapped several more photos. As the bird soared off, I noted its direction as more easterly than southerly for chasers. In total shock, I consulted a few northside birders and received a resounding affirmative on the GOEA ID, plopped the alert into discord, and began celebrating. Cook County year bird 293, tying the record. And what a way to do it!!!","9mph NW winds aiming approx 120 degrees SE through the region, low 30 temp, overcast. Sustained conditions following a slight cold dip on 11/26 with west winds that brought considerable SACRs, multiple WHCR, and 2 GOEAs to the county. Thanksgiving Day. Shifted to entrance of west side of cemetery when Scott joined following the GOEA alert.

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

I've seen this species here during my last 9 visits.,"Monthly birdwalk led by Wendy Paulson. Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

I followed it with my eyes until it landed 60% up on the northeast corner of the building on the intersection where the pin is. I ran to grab binoculars and a few colleagues to show them the bird. The bird perched for a few minutes before diving straight down onto the western sidewalk on Michigan ave below it, flushing a few pigeons. I could not see what was happening based on the angle, and strangely pedestrians didn't seem to flinch in that vicinity.

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions.

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Long eared owls were viewed for a minute before leaving them alone. Unfortunately, people were viewing them for extended periods of time, resulting in one being spotted and subsequently chased by several crows for minutes. Unsure if the owl survived. It's imperative that these owls are viewed very briefly. They're attempting to survive the winter in a degraded, urban environment. If we want more biodiversity at montrose, that means respecting their space and not alerting their presence to crows, hawks, etc."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Small sparrow species that was strikingly similar to a male house sparrow except with a rufous crown and a black spot on its light cheek. Associating with house sparrows. Seen well and diagnostically.    Dan and I were taking Ben on his first ever bird walk. Having only two binoculars and not expecting any rarities, I carried the camera and spotting scope around the sanctuary. While teaching Ben about house sparrows at the southeast end of the main trail, he pointed to a huge flock of house sparrows approximately 50 feet away north, down the main path, inquiring whether all of those birds were house sparrows. Not having binoculars on my person, I setup the spotting scope and started scanning, hoping to find an american tree sparrow or dark eyed junco to show him for contrast to the hordes of house sparrows that have consumed the commentary of his first bird walk. In only about a second, I noticed a weird looking brown sparrow in the flock with a spot on the cheek, slightly different size, and different colored head. Having seen this species once before in the parking lot of TNC's Nachusa Grasslands Preserve in April of 2023, I knew it was a eurasian tree sparrow. As I was readying my camera, the birds flushed due to some kind of disturbance not caused by us. I immediately reported the bird to fellow birders but, due to insecurity and confounding factors, was worried to officially ""call it."" After it was found an hour later and two birders remarked that they saw a ""weird"" looking house sparrow prior to me, I am confident I saw this bird.  We walked the main path for the remainder of our walk, throwing sunflower seeds to attract house sparrows and scanning for the eurasian, hoping for a photo to no avail.",With Dan and Ben. A spectacular surprise and my first solo rarity find for Cook county!

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Longspur with drabber features than expected LALO, smaller bill, more white in tail, underside of tail's black triangle differently shaped, higher pitched and more bubbly(?) rattle upon reflush.    Demond texted Phil and I photos asking about a Longspur he had flushed and my jaw dropped looking at his amazing flight shots. Immediately noticed drabber features, differently patterned tail than expected on LALO, and a voice in my head telling me that CCLO was seen in Michigan recently. Asked him to plop the photos in bird ID and began racing down to 566 before folks had even confirmed. Woody G, Erick M, Demond M (who stayed to help, legend!) and I reflushed the bird halfway down the gravel path before the bend when entering from the northern end of the park; it flew 50 or so feet down the path and hugged the left side, where Matthew C, Andy S, and Steve H arrived with their scopes. Had to run back home to work or would have stayed for hours with it. A legendary find only weeks after Demond had also found WEME at the same site. 2nd Cook county record and only a handful of records for the entire state.

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Nearly 0 movement on the lake (the entire day!), Jacob, Peter and Cameron leaving, and Erick asked about 566, so we headed there after a few hours.

Not complete and thorough yellow like an adult male, so this may be a female or first year male. Associated with red winged blackbirds, starlings, grackles, and cowbirds. First seen by Alex H at the pin in this field last weekend for only a few minutes before taking off. I spent several hours waiting for it to return that day with no luck. I returned the next day for a few more hours and same story. After a work week had gone by, Alex refound the bird in the same general location yesterday morning at 7am; about the same time he spotted the bird last weekend. With the winds and cold front changing after Sunday the 10th's evening, I knew that this morning would probably be my last chance at this particular individual. Important to note that folks did not expect the bird to linger, as this species seldom stays in one place and eBird records in cook county show that it's quite the fickle species to chase. Despite losing an hour of sleep due to daylight savings, I staked out at Alex H's pin for a third time in 7 days before dawn and, just like the two other stakeout sessions, tried picking out a yellowheaded blackbird from flocks of landing and flyby blackbirds. I parked across the road and stayed in the car with my binoculars and camera to not frighten visiting blackbird flocks. After about 20 minutes of waiting, a dozen blackbirds landed in the field and, for a quarter of a second, I saw a flash of yellow! Panicked, I readied my camera and tried focusing on the bird, but it didn't lock on immediately. I held down my shutter knowing that the bird may fly away just as quickly as it arrived, and I was right. I lingered at the location for about 20 more minutes and it actually returned a second time, right above the car in a tree which I checked because I heard red wingeds calling above me (that's how I got the photo from below).

Observations and photos taken at sunset with full sun giving more of a reddish, rufousey look to some photos. Photos TBD from Demond who got the best ones based on his orientation relative to us flushing the bird twice and his skill with camera. All 3 trip attendees got good looks at suspect bird. None of 3 meadowlarks we encountered sang nor called, hence not ruling out Eastern nor Western by sound. We flushed a total of 3 meadowlarks and honed in on this particular one after Demond got quick photos showing it matching the tail pattern from the morning's bird. Phil and Tarik then followed and flushed this particular bird a second time with Demond a bit farther and him getting more shots with the sun at his back. Bird was last flushed near the bend.

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."

Although it took some diligence, we eventually cobbled together an 11 warbler species day, great diversity for early October. The other group added Black-throated Green (=12), and I’m almost certain I got a quick glimpse of an Ovenbird (13?).    For me, however, the “bird of the day"" was a bat! We noted one flying in from the lake at ~8:15-8:20 am (landing in a large cottonwood by the parking lot, as did another prior to the birdwalk at ~7:10 am), plus a very high-flying bat at 8:20 am (heading in over the city). We then had two more that flew in and landed in a nearby pair of tall cottonwoods (8:37 am), and finally we discovered two perched Silver-haired Bats in a large maple by the ramped observation platform, one of which gave us a stunning close-up. Presumably all 7 bats were Silver-haireds.    A mercurial weather day, it started auspiciously (partly sunny and comfortable), but then became windy and overcast, before the wind abated and it returned to sunny and partly cloudy conditions. Temps felt cooler thanks to the strong N wind (65°F actually dropping to 62°F before creeping back up to 64°F)."
